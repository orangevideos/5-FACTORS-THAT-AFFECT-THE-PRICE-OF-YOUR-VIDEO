# 5-FACTORS-THAT-AFFECT-THE-PRICE-OF-YOUR-VIDEO
Factors that affect the cost of a video are endless. Sharing some common basic ones:  Type of video:  This is one of the most important factors that determines the cost of a video. A 3D video would cost more than a 2D animation video. A 2D video with more characters would cost less than a 2D video with lesser characters. Live action videos have different cost factors involved like location, equipment needed, etc.  Length of the video:  The calculation here is simple. A longer video will have a higher cost than a shorter one. A two-minute video literally has twice as many scenes as a one minute video.  Illustration Style:  A video using vector shapes and images takes less time and effort than a video that requires drawing and designing a character.  Voice-Over Artist:  Voice artists charge according to their versatility and experience. Also, the cost differs depending on the length of the script. A video that demands more than one voice artist, will incur a higher cost.  Timelines:  A video requirement that is urgent and requires burning the midnight oil will cost more than a video which has reasonable and fair timelines.
